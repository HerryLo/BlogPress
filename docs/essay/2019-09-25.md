## 令人百转千回念念不忘的墓志铭

#### 威斯特敏斯特大教堂地下室的墓碑林中的一则墓志铭。

【译文】“当我年轻，自由，当我的想象力没有尽头的时候，我梦想改变世界。当我长大，变得聪明，我发现世界是无法改变的，因而我收回眼底，决心只改变我的国家。但对国家我也无能为力。
在我垂老的时候，作为最后一搏，我决定改变我的家人，那些与我最亲近的人，可他们还是不可改变。
现在，当我临终之时，我才懂得：如果我能改变我自己，那么我可以用自己的榜样去改变家人。在他们的感召和鼓励下，我也许能让我的国家变得更好，进而，天晓得，我或许甚至能改变世界。”

【原文】“When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits, I dreamed of changing the world. As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world would not change,so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country.
But it, too, seemed immovable.
As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled for changing only my family, those closest to me, but alas, they would have none of it.
And now as I lie on my deathbed, I suddenly realize: If I had only changed my self first, then by example I would have changed my family.
From their inspiration and encouragement, I would then have been able to better my country and, who knows, I may have even changed the world.”

#### 神父马丁在波士顿犹太人被屠杀纪念碑的墓志铭

【】“起初他们追杀共产主义者，我没有说话———因为我不是共产主义者；
接着他们追杀犹太人，我没有说话———因为我不是犹太人；
后来他们追杀工会成员，我没有说话———因为我不是工会成员；
此后他们追杀天主教徒，我没有说话———因为我是新教教徒；
最后他们奔我而来，却再也没有人站出来为我说话了。”

【原文】“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.”

Then they came for me—
and there was no one left to speak for me.
